**what currently exists?**
A full-stack job tracking application with a FastAPI backend and React frontend.
-   **Backend:** The server features JWT auth, multi-provider AI (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq), and APIs for managing applications, interviews, and documents. Key additions include:
    -   A background job scheduler () that runs every 15 minutes to send interview reminders.
    -   Web Push Notification capability using  and VAPID keys, with endpoints to manage subscriptions.
    -   The  model now supports a  field.
-   **Frontend:** A polished React application. Key additions include:
    -   **CV Selector:** A dropdown in the application form to associate a CV with an application.
    -   **PWA Functionality:** The app has a , , and icons, making it installable.
    -   **Push Notifications:** A UI in the Settings page allows users to subscribe to and test push notifications.
    -   **Settings Page Refactor:** The layout has been improved to a 2-column grid.
    -   **Global Refresh Button:** A refresh button in the header re-fetches data across the app without a page reload, using a .
    -   **Dashboard Skeletons:** Animated loading skeletons are shown on the dashboard while data is being fetched to improve UX.
-   **Theme Switcher:** This feature was implemented but then reverted at the user's request. The code for it no longer exists, but it is a pending task.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Adding animated loading skeletons to the dashboard. The user reported that stats showed 0 during load, which was misleading. The agent added skeleton screens to the stats cards and recent applications list.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI,  for background tasks,  for Web Push notifications.
- **Frontend:** React,  for global state (), Custom Hooks, PWA (, ), Skeleton Loaders.
- **Architecture:** Client-side triggered data fetching supplemented by server-side background jobs for time-sensitive tasks (reminders).

**key DB schema**
- **applications:**  (updated)
- **notification_subscriptions:**  (new collection)

**changes in tech stack**
- **Backend:**
    - Added  for reliable background job scheduling.
    - Added  for sending VAPID-encrypted push notifications.

**All files of reference**
- : Updated with loading skeletons and integration of .
- : Refactored layout, fixed notification settings persistence, and added UI for push notifications.
- : Updated to include the global  and .
- : New file containing the core  logic for interview reminders.
- : Modified to handle push subscription and testing.
- : Modified to initialize and run the .
- , : New files for PWA functionality.
- : New file for the global data-refresh mechanism.

**key api endpoints**
- : Endpoint functionality was fixed to persist user notification preferences.
- : Subscribes a user's browser for push notifications.
- : Provides the public VAPID key to the frontend.
- : An admin/debug endpoint to check the status of the background scheduler.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You MUST communicate in French.**
- The user's highest priority upcoming task is re-implementing the **Light/Dark theme switcher**. The previous implementation was reverted via Unstaged changes after reset:
M	backend/tests/test_jobtracker_api.py
M	chrome-extension/README.md
M	memory/PRD.md, so you will be starting fresh but can refer to the agent's previous (now erased) logic.
- The user is highly focused on UI/UX. Pay close attention to visual details, loading states, and responsiveness.
- The reminder system is now a proper background job. Do not rely on the frontend to trigger it.
