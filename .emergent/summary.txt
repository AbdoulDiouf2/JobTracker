<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially wanted to build a V2 professional SaaS-style website called Job Tracking. The scope has significantly expanded based on user feedback to transform the application from a simple data tracker into a strategic career assistant.

Recent major feature requests include:
1.  **Dashboard Overhaul (Dashboard V2):** Transform the dashboard from a data viewer into an intelligent advisor. This includes adding a Job Search Score, progress tracking towards a monthly goal, rule-based insights, and data visualization for weekly progress.
2.  **Chrome Extension Authentication:** Remove the need for users to manually copy-paste JWT tokens. Implement a seamless authentication flow with both a direct email/password login within the extension and a one-click quick connect feature from the main web application's settings page.
3.  **SaaS-Ready Landing Page:** Completely rewrite the public landing page to present a professional, commercial-grade image, removing technical details and GitHub links.
4.  **Administrator Features:** Allow administrators to create new user accounts directly from the admin panel.
5.  **B2B / Multi-Tenant Features:** The user has provided a detailed long-term vision for a B2B version of the app, targeting schools and bootcamps, which has been documented in .
6.  **UI/UX Improvements:** Address a global zoomed-in feeling by adjusting the base font size, and redesign the Settings page for better organization and use of space.

**User's preferred language**:
The user's primary language is **French**. The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack job tracker with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The most recent session introduced significant enhancements:
-   **Dashboard V2:** The dashboard has been completely rebuilt. It now features a Job Search Score, a monthly application goal tracker, AI-like insights generated by backend business rules, and an evolution chart showing weekly activity.
-   **Chrome Extension Auth:** The extension now has a professional authentication system. Users can log in directly with their email/password or use a temporary code generated from the web app for a one-click connection. The JWT is securely stored in .
-   **Refactored Landing Page:** The  has been completely rewritten to reflect a commercial SaaS product, focusing on benefits rather than technical implementation.
-   **Refactored Settings Page:** The  has been redesigned into a full-width, multi-column layout with clearly organized categories for Profile, Notifications, and Integrations.
-   **Admin Skeletons:** Loading skeletons were added to the admin dashboard and user list pages for a better UX.
-   **Global UI Sizing:** The application's base font size was adjusted in  to  to make the UI feel more compact and less zoomed-in at 100% view.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the ability for an administrator to create a new user. The agent started by adding a new endpoint to  for this purpose.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Dashboard Card Spacing (P0)**
- **Issue 2: Sidebar Navigation Scroll Issue (P2)**

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
  - **Description:** After changing the base font size to  to fix a zoomed-in feeling, the user observed that cards on the dashboard appear too close together. The agent identified that -based  and  utilities were proportionally reduced. The user was redirected to another task before a fix could be implemented.
  - **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent only diagnosed the cause.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  Go to .
    2.  Identify the  containers using , , , or .
    3.  Increase the spacing values (e.g., change  to ) to visually compensate for the smaller base font size.
    4.  Take a screenshot to confirm the visual fix.

  - **Where to resume:** The backend endpoint was being added to . The next steps are:
    1.  Finish and test the backend endpoint.
    2.  Add a  function to the  hook in .
    3.  Add a Create User button to .
    4.  Implement a modal with a form to collect the new user's details (full name, email, password, role).
    5.  Call the  function from the modal and refresh the user list on success.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** Administrators will be able to provision new user accounts through the UI.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
  - **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P0: Implement Theme Switching (Light/Dark/System):** This was the user's top priority from the previous handoff but was deferred. It should be re-prioritized.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** Rule-based logic for generating Insights, composite Job Search Score calculation, temporary auth code generation for extension login.
-   **Frontend:** Complete component rewrites using Framer Motion, Recharts, and Shadcn UI. Global state management for user settings (e.g., ).
-   **Chrome Extension:** Using  to persist JWT across devices,  for inter-component communication, and managing UI state (logged in/out).

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** The user settings object associated with a user now includes a  field.
-   **backend (in-memory):** A temporary cache/dictionary is used to store  with their expiration.

**changes in tech stack**
-   No new libraries were added, but the usage of existing ones like  and  has become more prominent in the new dashboard.

**All files of reference**
-   : Completely rewritten for Dashboard V2.
-   : Completely rewritten for a new full-width layout.
-   : Completely rewritten for a commercial SaaS feel.
-   : Heavily modified to add all the logic for Dashboard V2.
-   : Modified to add endpoints for the Chrome Extension auth flow.
-   , : Rewritten to implement the new login UI and logic.
-   : The root  was changed to .
-   : New documentation file.

**key api endpoints**
-   : New endpoint to fetch all data for the redesigned dashboard.
-   : New endpoint for the web app to generate a temporary login code for the extension.
-   : New endpoint for the extension to exchange the temporary code for a long-lived JWT.
-   : (In Progress) New endpoint for an admin to create a user.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **You MUST communicate in French.**
-   **New Admin Credentials:** Use  with password . The previous  account does not have admin rights.
-   **Environment Date:** The test environment is set to the year **2026**. Any new test data that relies on dates (like applications) must be created with a 2026 date to be correctly processed by the backend logic.
-   The user is focused on building a commercial-grade SaaS product. Prioritize professional UI/UX, strategic features, and scalability over simple functionality.
-   The user frequently pivots to new tasks based on what they see. Be prepared to switch context and re-prioritize work.
